    <id>http://blog.rubystudio.net/blog/2012/06/27/blog-moved-to-octopress</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="right" src="http://i.imgur.com/WE86Qb.png"></p>

<p>We are very happy to anounce that we have moved to <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> as our blogging platform.
It's been a very smooth transition and we're enjoying immensely the ability to write clean semantic posts
on top of a solid Ruby platform. As another Octopress user put it: "Ruby is not just about Rails" and in this
case we couldn't agree more.</p>

<p>So what is Octopress? Self-labeled "A blogging framework for hackers", it's actually a very easy to deploy,
user-friendly platform, targeted at users who are comfortable with writing their posts by hand, using
semantic markup. Here's a quote from their website:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>Octopress is a framework designed by Brandon Mathis for Jekyll, the blog aware<br/>static site generator powering Github Pages. To start blogging with Jekyll, you<br/>have to write your own HTML templates, CSS, Javascripts and set up your<br/>configuration. But with Octopress All of that is already taken care of.<br/>Simply clone or fork Octopress, install dependencies and the theme, and youâ€™re set.</p><footer><strong>Brandon Mathis</strong> <cite><a href='http://octopress.org/'>Octopress.org</a></cite></footer></blockquote></p>

<p>It looks like both <a href="http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a> and <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> have
been gaining momentum for the past year with a lot of users going back to the roots of the clean,
semantic, standarts compliant Web, and it's a trend that we here at Ruby Studio deeply appreciate and support.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.rubystudio.net/blog/2012/06/26/new-version-of-our-website/"/>
    <updated>2012-06-26T16:41:00+03:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.rubystudio.net/blog/2012/06/26/new-version-of-our-website</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We have released the new iteration of our website <a href="http://rubystudio.net/">rubystudio.net</a>. It's a
complete rewrite, featuring a cleaner, more simplified look, taking full advantage of
<a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Twitter Bootstrap</a> and other JQuery goodies.
Under the hood there are a lot of changes too, most importantly all requests to all rubystudio subdomains
are now handled by a single monolithic app, utilizing the Rails 3.1+ <a href="http://railscasts.com/episodes/123-subdomains-revised">subdomain APIs</a>.
We have also switched our background workers from <code>delayed_job</code> to using <code>redis server</code> and <a href="https://github.com/defunkt/resque/">resque</a>.</p>

<p>Here are a few screenshot from this version:</p>

    <id>http://blog.rubystudio.net/blog/2012/03/20/in-development-lombard</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We have started the development of Lombard, a web based software, designed to fulfill all the needs
of a pawnshop: management and tracking of customers, deals, contracts, products, loans, payments,
renewals and sales. Fully compliant with Bulgarian trade law, it provides easy ways of generating
all the relevant documents, bills, tickets and registries required for day-to-day administration
and accountancy.
We expect this to be our primary development focus in the upcoming months with a release anticipated
somewhere midsummer.
Here's a sneak peak of the UI:</p>

    <id>http://blog.rubystudio.net/blog/2012/03/09/project-revamp-tis-bg-dot-com</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Another project revamp announcement, this time it's <a href="http://www.tis-bg.com/">tis-bg.com</a>. Formerly a PHP
application, it has now been rewritten in Rails 3.2, featuring a custom-built CMS and i18n features.
Working within the limits of our customer design requirements, we have kept the app simple and lightweight.
Like all our apps, it's fully HTML5 &amp; CSS3 compliant and very fast.</p>
