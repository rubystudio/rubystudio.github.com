    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We have released the new iteration of our website <a href="http://rubystudio.net/">rubystudio.net</a>. It's a
complete rewrite, featuring a cleaner, more simplified look, taking full advantage of
<a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Twitter Bootstrap</a> and other JQuery goodies.
Under the hood there are a lot of changes too, most importantly all requests to all rubystudio subdomains
are now handled by a single monolithic app, utilizing the Rails 3.1+ <a href="http://railscasts.com/episodes/123-subdomains-revised">subdomain APIs</a>.
We have also switched our background workers from <code>delayed_job</code> to using <code>redis server</code> and <a href="https://github.com/defunkt/resque/">resque</a>.</p>

<p>Here are a few screenshot from this version:</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We have started the development of Lombard, a web based software, designed to fulfill all the needs
of a pawnshop: management and tracking of customers, deals, contracts, products, loans, payments,
renewals and sales. Fully compliant with Bulgarian trade law, it provides easy ways of generating
all the relevant documents, bills, tickets and registries required for day-to-day administration
and accountancy.
We expect this to be our primary development focus in the upcoming months with a release anticipated
somewhere midsummer.
Here's a sneak peak of the UI:</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Another project revamp announcement, this time it's <a href="http://www.tis-bg.com/">tis-bg.com</a>. Formerly a PHP
application, it has now been rewritten in Rails 3.2, featuring a custom-built CMS and i18n features.
Working within the limits of our customer design requirements, we have kept the app simple and lightweight.
Like all our apps, it's fully HTML5 &amp; CSS3 compliant and very fast.</p>
