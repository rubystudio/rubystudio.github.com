3 ruby gems were added to our [portfolio](http://rubystudio.net/portfolio): [slovom](https://rubygems.org/gems/slovom),
[vatsim_metar](https://rubygems.org/gems/vatsim_metar) and [gcmapper](https://rubygems.org/gems/gcmapper).
These are all gems I have recently released and by including them in our portfolio we commit to supporting and
maintaining them officially, keeping them **current and compatible** with any newly released ruby/rails versions.

Here are the release announcements from my personal blog:

* [slovom - a ruby library for verbalizing currency](http://svilen.rubystudio.net/blog/2012/04/22/slovom-a-ruby-library-for-verbalizing-currency/)
* [vasim_metar: a ruby gem for displaying vatsim metars](http://svilen.rubystudio.net/blog/2012/06/30/vasim-metar-a-ruby-gem-for-displaying-vatsim-metars/)
* [gcmapper: a ruby gem for generating great circle maps](http://svilen.rubystudio.net/blog/2012/07/02/gcmapper-a-ruby-gem-for-generating-great-circle-maps/) + [update](http://svilen.rubystudio.net/blog/2012/07/02/gcmapper-updated-with-new-features/)
