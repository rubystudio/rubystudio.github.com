Another project revamp announcement, this time it's [tis-bg.com](http://www.tis-bg.com/). Formerly a PHP
application, it has now been rewritten in Rails 3.2, featuring a custom-built CMS and i18n features.
Working within the limits of our customer design requirements, we have kept the app simple and lightweight.
Like all our apps, it's fully HTML5 & CSS3 compliant and very fast.
