We have started the development of Lombard, a web based software, designed to fulfill all the needs
of a pawnshop: management and tracking of customers, deals, contracts, products, loans, payments,
renewals and sales. Fully compliant with Bulgarian trade law, it provides easy ways of generating
all the relevant documents, bills, tickets and registries required for day-to-day administration
and accountancy.
We expect this to be our primary development focus in the upcoming months with a release anticipated
somewhere midsummer.
Here's a sneak peak of the UI:
