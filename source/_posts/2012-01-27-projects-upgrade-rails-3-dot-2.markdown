We’ve upgraded our current projects to the [newly released rails 3.2](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/3_2_release_notes.html). The upgrade currently affects rubystudio.net, darvazaogrev.com, vasev.org. Rails 3.2 will be used for all future projects and revamps that are currently in development, and we’re also looking at moving [IP.Trac](http://iptrac.rubystudio.net/) to the 3.x branch.
