We have released the new version of [religiology.org](http://religiology.org/). While the visual look and feel
have been mostly preserved, it's rewritten from scratch as rails 3.2 application featuring a custom-built CMS
and powerful administration panel and toolset under the hood. The user experience has been greatly enhanced
wuth the website now being approximately 3 times faster, despite its heavy content.
