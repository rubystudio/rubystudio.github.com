We are very happy to anounce that we have moved to [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) as our blogging platform.
It's been a very smooth transition and we're enjoying immensely the ability to write clean semantic posts
on top of a solid Ruby platform. As another Octopress user put it: "Ruby is not just about Rails" and in this
case we couldn't agree more.

So what is Octopress? Self-labeled "A blogging framework for hackers", it's actually a very easy to deploy,
user-friendly platform, targeted at users who are comfortable with writing their posts by hand, using
semantic markup. Here's a quote from their website:

{% blockquote Brandon Mathis http://octopress.org/ Octopress.org %}
Octopress is a framework designed by Brandon Mathis for Jekyll, the blog aware
static site generator powering Github Pages. To start blogging with Jekyll, you
have to write your own HTML templates, CSS, Javascripts and set up your
configuration. But with Octopress All of that is already taken care of.
Simply clone or fork Octopress, install dependencies and the theme, and youâ€™re set.
{% endblockquote %}

It looks like both [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) and [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) have
been gaining momentum for the past year with a lot of users going back to the roots of the clean,
semantic, standarts compliant Web, and it's a trend that we here at Ruby Studio deeply appreciate and support.
